Running the reader and writer demo
==================================

The demo directory shows how to implement a sender and a receiver.  The
receiver is implemented in 2 variants. One uses syncronous (blocking)
communication while the other runs non blocking in the cxxtools event loop,
which processes events.

To run the demo a server is first needed. Run the `tntpubserver` from the
server directory in a terminal:

    cd /my/tntpub/directory/server
    ./tntpubserver

In another terminal start a reader from the demo directory. The readers expect
one or more topic names on the command line. The messages are printed in json
format to standard output.  We use _foobar_ as the topic name here:

    cd /my/tntpub/directory/demo
    ./exampleReader foobar   # or ./exampleAsyncReader foobar

A third terminal is needed to send a messsage. The message description can be
found in the header file `mymessage.h`. The sender reads messages in json
format from the standard input and sends it to the topic specified on the
command line. So we run:

    cd /my/tntpub/directory/demo
    echo '{text:"Hallo",number:42}'|./exampleSender foobar

We should see the message in the terminal where we started our reader. If we
have multiple terminals with readers we see the message in all of them.

To send multiple messages at once you may use the shell for that:

    for ((i = 0; i < 100; ++i)); do echo '{text:"Hallo",number:'$i'}'; done|./exampleSender foobar
